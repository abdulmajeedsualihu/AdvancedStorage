I started by creating my new workspace called MyFirstSmartContract in Remix IDE, then i created a new file called SimpleStorage.sol.
I then started writing my codes in the SimpleStorage.sol file, i first put on the SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT then added the solidity version whic is pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
I then stated the contract codes, then compiled it making sure there is no error.
I then headover to the git tab and connected my Remix IDE to my git hub account. NB: I already have a github tab from last meetings at KsTU.
After successful account binding, I then move to the Deploy and run transactions tab and making sure that the environment is selected to Remix VM and deploy the contract.
I then login to my github account and created a new repo called MyFirstSmartContract and went back straight to Git tab on Remix IDE and make sure the remote path, remote branch and then push the files to my github repo called MyFirstSmartContract

I really didn't had any issues due to the experience I had with Defi Team on Last Semester @KsTU.
 I used the function, struct, array, conditionals, loops, visibility specifiers and enums.
 i had numerous challenges along the way and i had to go back and read the course again in order to understand it well, sometimes i do visit google for answers too.
 Indeed last week was so challenging.
 I created mapping by "mapping(string => uint256) public nameToFavoriteNumber;"
 and events by "event NumberUpdated(uint256 newNumber, address updatedBy);"
and also used data locations such as memory, storage and call data.

In this weeks episode, i faced a lot of challenges the codes seems too difficult to understand and others.
